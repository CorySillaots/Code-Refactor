Horiseon Code Refactor Challenge for Module-01

The purpose of this challenge was to take an existing piece of code and ensure that all hyperlinks, accessibility standards and that the coding layout was relative to the application.

Installation:
In order to access the files needed to complete the challenge see: https://github.com/CorySillaots/module-1-challenge and clone either the following HTTPS link or SSH key:
HTTPS Link: https://github.com/CorySillaots/module-1-challenge.git
SSH Key: git@github.com:CorySillaots/module-1-challenge.git
In order to clone the project to a "projects" directory, open your terminal (mac) or gitbash (windows) window and type the following commands into your terminal/gitbash command line:
1 - mkdir projects
2 - cd ./projects (You can use the command "pwd" to ensure you are in the correct directory)
3 - git clone <HTTPS link> OR git clone <SSH Key>
4 - ls (this will list all of the files now inside of the current directory)

Open your coding software, select "open file" and locate the module-1-challenge file in your projects directory OR find the correct file in your directory and "Open With" your coding software.

Usage
- In index.html there were <div> tags that were switched to <section> to better organize the HTML code.
- <div> was changed to <footer> at the bottom section of the page.
- "Search Engine Optimization" hyperlink needed to be linked correctly. 
- Accessibility features were added to the images using the <alt> function.
- A title was added in the <title></title> at the top of the page to label the pages tab.
- style.css had functions consolidated where appropriate.
- style.css had functions reorganized in order to keep them together in common groups. 
- Notes were added to both index.html and style.css in order to navigate through the code more easily.
